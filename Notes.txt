# if facing issues while pip commpile while using database, install below
sudo apt update
sudo apt install pkg-config
sudo apt install libmysqlclient-dev
sudo apt install libmariadb-dev


# NOTE-
1. when sql database doesn't exists from the start, we need to create the database.
2. usually database container restarts when building for 1st time. add health check logic in it's service definition like below.
    healthcheck:
        test: ["CMD-SHELL", "pg_isready -U your_user"]
        interval: 10s
        timeout: 5s
        retries: 5
